NONCLUSTERED INDEX

A nonclustered index is analogous to an index in a textbook. The data
is stored in one place, the index in another place. The index will have
pointers to the storage location of the data

Since the nonclustered index is stored separately from the actual data, 
a table can have more than one non-clustered index, just like how a book can
have an index by Chapters at the beginning and another index by common terms 
at the end.

In the index itself, the data is stored in an ascending or descending order
of the index key, which doesn't in any way influence the storage of data
in the table

SYNTAX

 CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_tblEmployee_Name ON tblEmployee(Name)


But CLUSTERED INDEX IN FASTER than a non clustered index, because,
the nonclustered index has to refer back to the table, if the selected column
is not present in the index.

and clustered index dtermines the storage order of rows in the table, hence
doesn't require additional disk space, but where as a non clustered index is 
stored separately from the table, additional storage space is required
